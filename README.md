# simple-node-and-express-projects

These are all the simple Node and Express projects! 

I am undertaking these projects to get familiar with Node.js and Express concepts through practical application.

The primary goal of these projects is to gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of Node.js and Express. Each project focuses on different aspects of these technologies, allowing me to explore various concepts and techniques.

* Setting up a simple Express server.
* Understanding middleware and routing.
* Serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* Exploring the `express.static` middleware.
